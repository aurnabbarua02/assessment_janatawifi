<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project displays 'Stock Market Data' in a chart and table format using 'React.js' as the frontend and 'Django' as the backend. While working on this project, I faced many challenges, and overcoming them helped me learn a lot.</p>

<h2>Challenges I Faced</h2>
<ul>
 <li>Although I had prior experience with 'Django' and 'React.js' separately, I had never worked with both simultaneously. Combining them was a challenging task.</li> 
  <li>I had never used 'react-charts' before, so properly displaying the chart was difficult.</li> 
  <li>After implementing the chart, I initially used an HTML 'select' element, but it did not work properly. Fixing this issue was challenging. </li> 
  <li>At first, I used an 'HTML table' to display the data, but it loaded all the data at once, significantly slowing down the page. To solve this, I 
     had to implement 'react-data-table-component', which was also challenging. </li>
</ul>

<h2>What I Learned</h2>
<ul> 
  <li>How to integrate 'React.js' as a frontend with 'Django' as a backend.</li> 
  <li>How to implement 'react-charts' for data visualization.</li> 
  <li>The existence and usage of 'react-select', which efficiently handles select operations.</li> 
  <li>How to implement 'react-data-table-component' for better performance.</li> 
</ul>
